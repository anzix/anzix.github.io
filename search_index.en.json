подключались и не можете снова подключится, попробуйте удалить из списка Blueman или Bluedevil геймпад и тогда он в списке должен появится и подключится номрмально.\nДанный геймпад работает хорошо со

N\" (Глава 16, страница 391) в\nкачестве подопытного.\n#&nbsp;\nПонятие отладочная информация\nДля чего нужны отладочные символы?\nОтладочные символы в основном полезны для получения трассировок (backtrace)\nотладки для устранения неполадок во время выполнения.\nО том что выбрать в компиляторе gcc, флаг -g или -g1?\n\n\nФлаг -g используется для генерации отладочной информации (с elf объекта) в\nформате Dwarf, который является форматом по умолчанию, используемым GCC. Этот\nформат включает информацию об исходном коде, такую как номера строк, имена\nпеременных и типы. Отладочная информация хранится в исполняемом файле, что\nпозволяет отлаживать программу с помощью таких инструментов, как GDB.\nКомпиляция с данным флагом для крупных проектов может быть как правило очень\nмедленным\n\n\nФлаг -g1 флаг который генерирует минимальную отладочную информацию. Он похож\nна -g, но он содержит только самую важную информацию, такую как таблица номера\nстрок, описания функций и внешних переменных. Но не будет информации о локальных\nпеременных. Это уменьшает размер отладочной информации, делая исполняемый файл меньше.\nФайл inventory без отладочной информации, а inventory-debug с флагами отладки\n-g3. Что является максимальная отладочная информация и вот как значительно весят\nдва разных исполняемых файла\n\nВот как весит файл inventory-debug с флагом -g1\n\n\n\nЧто за флаг -ggdb&lt;уровень&gt;?\n\n\n-ggdb&lt;уровень&gt;: Создавать отладочную информацию для использования GDB. Это\nозначает использование наиболее выразительного доступного формата (DWARF, st\nabs или собственный формат, если ни один из них не поддерживается),\nвключая расширения GDB, если это вообще возможно.\n\nДля совместимости с использованием другого отладчика как Valgrind лучше всего\nограничится -g1\n\n\n\n#&nbsp;\nПлохая отладка программы\nВот как выглядит плохой способ отладки при получения трассировки (backtrace)\nЗапускаем отладчик gdb /usr/bin/inventory, записываем логи set logging enabled on,\nзапускаем программу run.

Достаточно просто глянуть $DEBUGINFOD_URLS переменную\nчтобы убедится.\n\nЭто очень полезно как для отладки своего ПО так и просто помощь людям\nкоторым вы хотите помочь.\nПриступим\n\n\nЕсть два варианта:\n\n\nЕсли столкнулись с SEGFAULT и вы хотите помочь отладить стороннего ПО:\nВызываем отладчик используя coredump команду: $ coredumpctl debug PID\nДля поиска PID вызовите coredumpctl list\n\n\nЕсли же вы отлаживаете своё ПО: То просто вызываете gdb путь/до/исполняемого\n\n\n\n\nЕсли спрашивает Enable debuginfod for this session? (y or [n]) обязательно\nсоглашаемся на y (это может использовать до нескольких сотней МБ трафика для\nзагрузки файлов отладочной информации)\n\n\nЕсли возникает это жмём c и Enter\n\n\n\nПо умолчанию если включить логирование то название будет gdb.txt, если оно\nвам не нравиться то вы можете использовать команду (gdb) set logging file your_file_name.log\nПосле этого включить логирование в файл (gdb) set logging enabled on\n\n\nЗапускаете отслеживание (backtrace) (gdb) bt или запускаете программу\n(gdb) run (может долго запускаться потому-что загружает отладочную\nинформацию)\n\n\nВ случае если программа работает и в какой-то момент останавливается\n(например kill -SIGSEGV pid) запустите (gdb) thread apply all bt full,\nпосле окончания вы можете отключить логирование (gdb) set logging enabled off.\nИ выходим на q и соглашаемся выйти на y\n\n\nТеперь если вы получили лог файл который вы хотите отправить разработчикам, вы\nможете отредактировать в нём любую личную информацию, если она слишком длинная,\nпоместите ее в любой сервис pastebin и поделитесь ссылкой\n\n\n#&nbsp;\nВот как используется debuginfod в инфраструктуре Arch Linux\nДля официальных пакетов в репозиториях Core и Extra\n\n\nСобирается пакет с опцией debug (выставлен в PKGBUILD)\n\n\nПри сборке обычный пакет (содержащий executable) и *-debug (содержащий\ndebuginfo) пакет отправляется в сервер debuginfod который индексирует отладочную\nинформацию.\n\n\nВ вашем дистрибутиве по умолчанию будет указан свой сервер debuginfod (для Arch Linux это\nhttps://debuginfod.archlinux.org) откуда берётся и извлекается отладочная\nинформация во время выполнения отладчика используя gdb/Valgrind.\n\n\nПользователю (клиенту) можно сразу отлаживать программу и она сразу всю\nотладочную информацию скачает.\n\n\nПоэтому для клиентов не имеет смысл качать пакет *-debug (хоть это возможно),\nтак как они уже индексированы на наличие отладочной информации.\n\n\n(Опционально): Для улучшения поиска отладочной информации стоит ещё добавить\nURL сервера debuginfod помимо Arch Linux через пробел:\n\nСписок всех доступных публичных серверов указаны тут\n\n\nДля неофициальных пакетов (AUR):\nВ то время как наше ПО поставляется неофициально, в виде пакета AUR,\nв установке *-debug пакета имеет смысл. Так как это единственный удобный\nвариант отладки и получения отладочных символов (debug symbols), особенно для\nдобровольцев кто хочет помочь развивать ваше ПО.\n#&nbsp;\nОтладочный пакет *-debug для неофициальных пакетов в Arch Linux (для разработчиков)\n\nРекомендации по пакету Arch\nArch Wiki Debugging\n\nКак было сказано, помимо обычного пакета inventory следом идёт отладочный пакет\ninventory-debug добавленными отладочными символами\nНужно указать в PKGBUILD опцию debug чтобы создавался inventory-debug\nпакет вместе с обычным пакетом.\n\n\nЕсли вы спросите \"нужно ли менять секцию build() тип компиляции команды\nmake на debug?\", ответ \"Нет, не нужно\". Потому-что при включённой опции\ndebug используются флаги DEBUG_CFLAGS и DEBUG_CXXFLAGS из конфиг\nфайла /etc/makepkg.conf. Собственно добавляются в CFLAGS и используются\nкомпилятором gcc, это описано здесь.\nОДНАКО (для больших проектов), вы можете переопределить флаги отладки в основном только для\nпакетизации, например в Arch Linux файле PKGBUILD переопределить флаги отладки\nDEBUG_CFLAGS или DEBUG_CXXFLAGS на свои (DEBUG_CFLAGS=\" -g1\") для\nгенерации минимальных отладочных файлов. Это может значительно ускорить\nкомпиляцию и уменьшить размер этих данных для вносчиков и позволит упаковать\nданные в debuginfod\" (не понял, что это значит? FIXME)\n\nРаз речь зашла про PKGBUILD то при отладке рекомендуется использовать опцию\ncheck которая активирует секцию check() (если она присутвтвует)\nНичего больше изменять/добавлять в PKGBUILD не нужно. Тепепрь собираем пакет\nиспользуя команду makepkg -sric\nСборка с отладочным пакетом будет идентично с тем как поставляются пакеты в\nотдельном зеркале\nСимволы отладки после установки пакета находятся в /usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/inventory.debug\nТеперь можно использовать gdb для отладки моего ПО.\n\nИз выхлопа ниже, обратите внимание, что отладочная информация для /usr/bin/inventory\nзагрузилась также из /usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/inventory.debug. Файлы с отладочной\nинформацией хранятся в дереве /usr/lib/debug/.

получается сделать откат на снимок используя snapper-rollback который соответствует разметке Arch Linux.\nВылезает ошибка что файловая система только для чтения /btrfsroot.\nЧто-то мешает snapper-rollback выполнение отката даже с правами sudo (плюс в конфиге /etc/snapper-rollback.conf выставлено dev устройство).\nРанее на других окружениях с другими DM это срабатывало.\n\nРешение:\nНеобходимо в Arch ISO под chroot'ом создать папку /btrfsroot\n\nИ смонтировать её с данными флагами\nОБЯЗАТЕЛЬНО:\n\nУказываете тот номер раздела который у вас смонтирован как / у меня это /dev/vda2\nВ subvolid указываете 5\n\n\nПосле чего команда sudo snapper-rollback [num_snapshots] работает и откатывает систему\nПосле отката в выхлопе команды sudo btrfs su li / появился подтом с таким именем\n\nЭтот подтом находится по пути /btrfsroot/\nВ @2023-08-30T16:08 находится сломанная система с удалённым которую мы откатили на рабочий снимок\nУдалить его можно командой\n\n#&nbsp;\nОтсутствующие метки новых снимков в grub\nИногда после выполнения отката используя команды snapper-rollback могут не показываться созданные метки снимков в меню grub которые делает grub-btrfs\nИсправляется это переустановкой grub, выполнением grub-install в тоже самое место и grub-mkconfig (если у вас есть хук grub-upgrade.hook тогда он сам за вас всё сделает)\nИ он будет удалён из списка\n#&nbsp;\nЧто использовать systemd сервис grub-btrfsd или snap-pac-grub и в чём разница?\n\nРазница заключается в том что сервис grub-btrfsd обновляет записи в фоне при любом изменении или добавлении снимков в /.snapshots\nа пакет snap-pac-grub добавляет записи только для pre и post транзакциях pacman и обновляет записи сразу (однако крайний post не включает)\n\nВключается сервис grub-btrfsd командой\n\n#&nbsp;\nНастройка snapper для снимков /home каталога\nЗдесь подготовка и настройка практически такая же как и с корневым каталогом / но с мелкими отличиями\nОднако снимки и их восстановление и откат будет происходить по другому\nСоздаём подтом с названием @home.snapshots нужно чтобы он был также toplevel\n\n\nПерезагружаем демонов и монтируем\n\nРазмонтируем и удаляем /home/.snapshots\n\nСоздаю конфигурацию Snapper для /home\nSnapper отслеживая этот путь будет создавать снимки всех пользователей (если они присутствуют)\n\nУдаляем подтом /home/.snapshots

пользователям\n\nНастройка Snapper\nНе создавать timeline-снимки для /home\n\nОБЯЗАТЕЛЬНО добавьте в конфиг файле /etc/updatedb.conf внутри PRUNEPATHS путь снимков /home/.snapshots от предотвращения индексирования программой \"updatedb\" т.к это будет замедлять работу системы\nГотово, теперь как вернуть home до момента чистой установки (TTY) [делал после отката root]\\\nСмотрим список снимков home командой\n\nИ откатываем командой и на выходе получится\n\nРаботает прекрасно, теперь $HOME чист от KDE конфиг файлов\n#&nbsp;\nИсключить каталоги от снимков в $HOME\nДля этого надо просто добавить подтом (subvolume) как путь, НО перед этим, каталоги с этим путём надо создать\nВ качестве примера я буду использовать flatpak виртуальную машину gnome-boxes\n\nСоздаём подтом images командой от пользователя (non-root)\n\nТеперь образы (qcow) которых не будут присутствовать в снимках и собственно не будут занимать место и раздувать его\nТакже я дополнительно добавил ~/.local и ~/.cache, так как они уже содержат файлы мне необходимо их переместить во временную папку, потом сразу создать подтом и обратно переместить из временной папки в ~/.local и ~/.cache\n\nСмотрим как это выглядит\n\nТеперь снапшотим $HOME используя snapper команду\n\nИ после обзора этого снимка видно что файлов внутри ~/.local и ~/.cache нету\n#&nbsp;\nСоветы и трюки\nРучные одиночные снимки\n\n(Не проверено) Сравнить снапшот файл\n\nВосстановление удаленного файла\n\n(Не проверено) Восстановить предыдущую версию файла из снимка\n\nУдалить снимок\n\nПримечание: При удалении pre-снимка всегда следует удалять соответствующий ему post-снимок, и наоборот.\n\nЧтобы удалить снимок с номером N, выполните:\n\nКак узнать занимаемое место снимков?\n\nВидео инструкция другой метод\n\n\nПокажу на примере моего древнего снимка 2737 которому 7 месяцев и он всё это время не удалялся,\nв то время сейчас у меня текущий по дате снимок является 6402.\n\nПри удалении этого снимка он освободил у меня около 10-11гб.\nПоэтому следует обращать внимание на Exclusive\n#&nbsp;\nКак откатится в read-write снапшот после сломанной системы (Arch way)\n\nКак указано из Arch Wiki команда snapper rollback не предназначена для текущей разметки Arch Linux, когда я тестировал её, после выполнения ранее удалённый рекурсивно /etc не восстановила и из-за этого я не смог загрузится в систему. Поэтому необходимо использовать другой метод для отката системы.\n\nДля самого простого и не затруднительного метода есть AUR пакет snapper-rollback который соответствует схеме разметки Arch Linux\nПри его установке необходимо отредактировать конфиг /etc/snapper-rollback.conf и в самом конце раскоментировать строку dev и указать ваш /dev/sda[номер] раздел на который смонтирован как /\nЕсли у вас есть записи снапшотов grub при установке grub-btrfs и в вашей системе что-то сломалось, загружаемся в рабочий снимок и для отката вводим команду\n\nИ после перезагрузки у вас будет восстановленная система\n#&nbsp;\nНе получается откатится из-за малого объёма диска\nЕсли например случилась проблема при обновлении Arch Linux и у вас нету места в разделе / тогда команда sudo snapper-rollback не сможет сделать откат выдав ошибку о том что недостаточно места\n\nИменно поэтому не рекомендуется не заполнять в край / раздел если пользуетесь файловой системой Btrfs\nОднако если боитесь столкнутся с таким попробуйте вот что рекомендуется делать:\n\nУдалить старые снимки\n\n\nВоспользовавшись snapper\n\n\n\nМожно это сделать ручным методом\n\n\n\nОграничить кол-во снимков\n\n\n#&nbsp;\nМожно обойтись без snapper-rollback от сделать это вручную?\nОтвет - да, можно. Вот как это сделать находясь в выбранный через меню grub read-only снимок:\n\nГотово\n#&nbsp;\nПроблема: Не добавляются новые записи снимков в grub при использовании grub-btrfsd\nЯ сталкивался с этим после отката в окружении Gnome на VM когда пытался удалить /etc директорию.\nПосле отката новые снимки почему-то не добавлялись в grub меню\nРешением было переустановка пакета grub с командой grub install ... и дальнейшим пересозданием конфига grub-mkconfig ...\n","id":"https://anzix.github.io/posts/snapper-snapshots/","title":"Snapper - бэкап файловой системы Btrfs"},"https://anzix.github.io/posts/solving-problem-compositor-picom/":{"body":"#&nbsp;\n1.(Решил) Проблема\nСтолкнулся с графическим глюком при переходе в полноэкранный (win+f) на любом терминале, но когда двигаешь мышкой или нажав клавишу - пропадает\n\nРешается это отключением fading (затухание)\nЛибо отключить dual_kawase\n#&nbsp;\n2.(Решил) Проблема\nПри вызове maim (минимального скриншотера) появляется размытый экран вместо чистого\nРешается это добавлением в исключение blur'а picom\nmaim вызывает slop поэтому необходимо именно его добавить в исключение\n\n#&nbsp;\n3.(Решил) Проблема\nНекоторые элементы (например toolbar, всплыв-е окна и т.д) имеют на краях слой прозрачности от blur'а dual_kawase\nРешается это добавлением данной строки\n\n#&nbsp;\n!4.(???)
